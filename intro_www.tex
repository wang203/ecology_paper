\section{Introduction}

The popularity of social networking websites has grown dramatically
over the last few years, creating enormous collections of
user-generated content online. Photo-sharing sites have become
particularly popular: Flickr and Facebook alone have amassed an
estimated 100 billion images, with over 100 million new images
uploaded every day~\cite{Kremerskothen11}.  People use these
sites to share photos with family and friends, but in the process they
are creating immense public archives of information about the world:
each photo is a record of what the world looked like at a particular
point in time and space.  When combined together, the billions of
photos on these sites combined with metadata including timestamps,
geo-tags, and captions are a rich untapped source of information about
the state of the world and how it is changing over
time.

Recent work has studied how to mine passively-collected data
from social networking and microblogging websites to make estimates
and predictions about world events, including tracking the spread of
disease~\cite{ginsberg09flu}, monitoring for fires and
emergencies~\cite{delongueville09}, predicting product adoption rates
and election outcomes~\cite{jin10prediction}, and estimating aggregate
public mood~\cite{oconnor10mood,bollen11twitter}. In most of these
studies, however, there is either little ground truth available to
judge the quality of the estimates and predictions, or the available
ground truth is an indirect proxy (e.g. since no aggregate public mood
data exists, \cite{oconnor10mood} evaluates against opinion polls,
while~\cite{bollen11twitter} compares to stock market indices).  While
these studies have demonstrated promising results, it is not yet clear
when crowd-sourcing data from social media sites can yield reliable
estimates, or how to deal with the substantial noise and bias in these
datasets. Moreover, these studies have largely focused on textual
content and have not taken advantage of the vast amount of visual
content online.

In this paper, we study the particular problem of estimating
geo-temporal distributions of ecological phenomena using geo-tagged,
time-stamped photos from Flickr.  Our motivations to study this
particular problem are three-fold.  First, biological and ecological
phenomena frequently appear in images, both because photographers take
photos of them purposely (e.g. close-ups of plants and animals) or
incidentally (a bird in the background of a family portrait, or the
snow in the action shot of children sledding).  Second, for the two
phenomena we study here, snowfall and vegetation cover, large-scale
(albeit imperfect) ground truth is available in the form of
observations from satellites and ground-based weather stations.  Thus
we can explicitly evaluate the accuracy of various techniques for
extracting semantic information from large-scale social media
collections.

Third, while ground truth is available for these particular
phenomena, for other important ecological phenomena (like the geo-temporal distribution of plants and animals) no such data is
available, and social media could help fill this need.
%, and mining data from social media has the potential to fill
%this gap.  
In fact, perhaps no community is in greater need of
real-time, global-scale information on the state of the world than the
scientists who study climate change. Recent work shows that global
climate change is impacting a variety of flora and fauna at local,
regional and continental scales: for example, species of
high-elevation and cold-weather mammals have moved northward, some
species of butterflies have become extinct, waterfowl are losing
coastal wetland habitats as oceans rise, and certain fish populations
are rapidly declining~\cite{ipcc2007climate}. However monitoring these
changes is surprisingly difficult: plot-based studies
involving direct observation of small patches of land yield
high-quality data but are costly and possible only at very small
scales, while aerial surveillance gives data over
large land areas but cloud cover, forests, atmospheric
conditions and mountain shadows can interfere with the observations,
and only certain types of ecological information can be collected from
the air.  To understand how biological phenomena are responding to
both landscape changes and global climate change, ecologists need an
efficient system for ground-based data collection to give detailed
observations across the planet.  A new approach
for creating ground-level, continental-scale datasets is to use
passive data-mining of the huge number of visual observations produced
by millions of users worldwide, in the form of digital images uploaded
to photo-sharing websites.


\xhdr{Challenges.}
There are two key challenges to unlocking the ecological
information latent in these photo datasets. The first is how to recognize 
ecological phenomena appearing in photos and how to map these observations to
specific places and times. Fortunately, modern photo-sharing sites
collect a rich variety of non-visual
information about photos, including metadata recorded by the digital
camera --- exposure settings and timestamps, for example --- as well as
information generated during social sharing  ---
text tags, comments, and ratings, for example. Many sites also
record the
 geographic coordinates of where on Earth a photo was taken, as reported either by a GPS-enabled camera or smartphone, or input manually by the user.
Thus online photos include the ingredients
necessary to produce geo-temporal data about the world,
including information about content (images, tags and comments), and
when (timestamp) and where (geotag) each photo was taken.

The second challenge is how to deal with the biases and noise inherent
in online data. People do not photograph the Earth evenly,
 so there are disproportionate concentrations of
activity near cities and tourist attractions. Photo metadata is often
noisy or inaccurate; for example, users forget to set the clock on
their camera, GPS units fail to find fixes, and users
carelessly tag photos.  Even photos without such errors might be
misleading: the tag ``snow'' on an image might refer to a snow lily or a
snowy owl, while snow appearing in an image might be artificial (as in an indoor zoo exhibit).

\xhdr{This paper.}  In this paper we study how to mine data from
photo-sharing websites to produce crowd-sourced observations of
ecological phenomena.  As a first step towards the longer-term goal of
mining for many types of phenomena, here we study two in particular:
ground snow cover and vegetation cover (``green-up'') data. Both are
critical features for ecologists monitoring the earth's ecosystems.
Importantly for our study, these two phenomena have accurate
fine-grained ground truth available at a continental scale in the form
of observations from aerial instruments like NASA's Terra earth-observing
satellites~\cite{modisveg,modissnow} or networks of ground-based
observing stations run by the U.S. National Weather Service. This
data allows us to evaluate the performance of our crowd-sourced data mining
techniques at a very large scale, including thousands of days of data
across an entire continent.
%This evaluation gives insight into how accurate crowd-sourced 
%observations could be for tracking ecological phenomena for which
%no ground truth exists.
 Using a dataset of nearly 150 million geo-tagged Flickr photos, we
 study whether this data can potentially be a
 reliable resource for scientific research.  An example comparing
 ground truth snow cover data with the estimates produced by our
 Flickr analysis on one particular day (December 21, 2009) is shown in
 Figure~\ref{fig:samplemap}. Note that the Flickr analysis is sparse
 in places with few photographs, while the satellite data is missing
 in areas with cloud cover, but they agree well in areas where both
 observations are present. This (and the much more extensive experimental results presented later in the paper) suggests that Flickr analysis may produce
 useful observations either on its own or as a complement other
 observational sources.
